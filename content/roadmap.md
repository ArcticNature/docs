The features are many but the time is little.
The options are endless and the ideas abundant.
With the list of features I want to implement already large and growing still
this page has the important task of determinig focus.

This, non-exclusive, list of features are the main targets I want to achive
as I progress with the development of SnowFox.
As the system is at the very early stages this list will include a lot of
fundation work but once that is out of the way many cool features will make
their way into it.


Distribution task
-----------------
The release task takes care of producing items that run the system but
not in an easy to deliver format.
Package the daemon and zip the docs in convenient formats to deploy.


Git Repository
--------------
The current version only has a fake repository supported for development
reasons.
Implement the git based repository component to allow release builds to start.


Example server with netcat
--------------------------
The default configuration repository could do with a little more examples.
Add a service that starts a netcat server and demonstrate the results of it.


Documentation pages
-------------------
The essential set of pages needs to be extended further with the configuration
refenrece page and auto-generated daemon and JSON api pages.
