The features are many but the time is little.
The options are endless and the ideas abundant.
With the list of features I want to implement already large and growing still
this page has the important task of determinig focus.

This, non-exclusive, list of features are the main targets I want to achive
as I progress with the development of SnowFox.
As the system is at the very early stages this list will include a lot of
fundation work but once that is out of the way many cool features will make
their way into it.


Example server with netcat
--------------------------
The default configuration repository could do with a little more examples.
Add a service that starts a netcat server and demonstrate the results of it.


Documentation pages
-------------------
The essential set of pages needs to be extended further with the configuration
refenrece page and auto-generated daemon and JSON api pages.
